      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
Tamil Nadu[a] is the southernmost state of India. The tenth largest Indian state by area and the sixth largest by population, Tamil Nadu is the home of the Tamil people, who speak the Tamil language—the state's official language and one of the longest surviving classical languages of the world. The capital and largest city is Chennai.      </p>
      <p>Located on the south-eastern coast of the Indian peninsula, Tamil Nadu is straddled by the Western Ghats and Deccan Plateau in the west, the Eastern Ghats in the north, the Eastern Coastal Plains lining the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait to the south-east, the Laccadive Sea at the southern cape of the peninsula, with the river Kaveri bisecting the state. Politically, Tamil Nadu is bound by the Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and encloses a part of the union territory of Puducherry. It shares an international maritime border with the Northern Province of Sri Lanka at Pamban Island.</p>
      <p>Archaeological evidence indicates that the Tamil Nadu region could have been inhabited more than 385,000 years ago by archaic humans. The state has more than 5,500 years of continuous cultural history. Historically, the Tamilakam region was inhabited by Tamil-speaking Dravidian people, who were ruled by several regimes over centuries such as the Sangam era triumvirate of the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas, the Pallavas (3rd–9th century CE) and the later Vijayanagara Empire (14th–17th century CE). European colonisation began with establishing trade ports in the 17th century, with the British controlling much of the state as a part of the Madras Presidency for two centuries. After the Indian Independence in 1947, the region became the Madras State of the Republic of India and was further reorganised when states were redrawn linguistically in 1956 into its current shape. The state was renamed as Tamil Nadu, meaning "Tamil Country", in 1969. Hence, culture, cuisine and architecture have seen multiple influences over the years and have developed diversely.</p>
      <p>As of December 2023, Tamil Nadu had an economy with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹27.22 trillion (US$320 billion), making it the second-largest economy amongst the 28 states of India. It has the country's 9th-highest GSDP per capita of ₹315,220 (US$3,700) and ranks 11th in human development index. Tamil Nadu is also one of the most industrialised states, with the manufacturing sector accounting for nearly one-third of the state's GDP. With its diverse culture and architecture, long coastline, forests and mountains, Tamil Nadu is home to a number of ancient relics, historic buildings, religious sites, beaches, hill stations, forts, waterfalls and four World Heritage Sites. The state's tourism industry is the largest among the Indian states. The state has three biosphere reserves, mangrove forests, five National Parks, 18 wildlife sanctuaries and 17 bird sanctuaries. The Tamil film industry, nicknamed as Kollywood, plays an influential role in the state's popular culture.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-3">Etymology</h2>
      <img src="./static/images/Etymology.jpg" alt="Tamil Script" class="w-96 h-96 rounded-lg mb-4">
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
The name is derived from Tamil language with nadu meaning "land" and Tamil Nadu meaning "the land of Tamils". The origin and precise etymology of the word Tamil is unclear with multiple theories attested to it.[7] In the ancient Sangam literature, Tamilakam refers to the area of present-day Tamil Nadu, Kerala and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Tolkāppiyam (2nd to 1st century BCE) indicates the borders of Tamilakam as Tirumala and Kanniyakumari.[8] The name Tamilakam is used in other Sangam era literature such as Puṟanāṉūṟu, Patiṟṟuppattu, Cilappatikaram and Manimekalai.[9] Cilappatikaram (5th to 6th century CE) and Ramavataram (12th century CE) mention the name Tamil Nadu to denote the region.[10][11][12]      </p>

Administration and politics
Administration </p>
      <p>Chennai is the capital of the state and houses the state executive, legislative and head of judiciary.[160] The administration of the state government functions through various secretariat departments. There are 43 departments of the state and the departments have further sub-divisions which may govern various undertakings and boards.[161] The state is divided into 38 districts, each of which is administered by a District Collector, who is an officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) appointed to the district by the Government of Tamil Nadu. For revenue administration, the districts are further subdivided into 87 revenue divisions administered by Revenue Divisional Officers (RDO) which comprise 310 taluks administered by Tahsildars.[162] The taluks are divided into 1349 revenue blocks called Firkas which consist of 17,680 revenue villages.[162] The local administration consists of 15 municipal corporations, 121 municipalities and 528 town panchayats in the urban areas and 385 panchayat unions and 12,618 village panchayats, administered by Village Administrative Officers (VAO).[163][162][164] Greater Chennai Corporation, established in 1688, is the second oldest in the world and Tamil Nadu was the first state to establish town panchayats as a new administrative unit.[165][166][167][163]</p>
    <p>Legislature</p>
    <p>In accordance with the Constitution of India, the governor is a state's de jure head and appoints the chief minister who has the de facto executive authority.[168][169] The Indian Councils Act 1861 established the Madras Presidency legislative council with four to eight members but was a mere advisory body to the governor of the presidency. The strength was increased to twenty in 1892 and fifty in 1909.[170][171] Madras legislative council was set-up in 1921 by the Government of India Act 1919 with a term of three years and consisted of 132 Members of which 34 were nominated by the Governor and the rest were elected.[172] The Government of India Act 1935 established a bicameral legislature with the creation of a new legislative council with 54 to 56 members in July 1937.[172]

The first legislature of Madras state under the Constitution of India was constituted on 1 March 1952 after the 1952 elections. The number of seats post the reorganisation in 1956 was 206, which was further increased to 234 in 1962.[172] In 1986, the state moved to a unicameral legislature with the abolition of the Legislative Council by the Tamil Nadu Legislative Council (Abolition) act, 1986.[173] The Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly is housed in the Fort St. George in Chennai.[174] The state elects 39 members to the Lok Sabha and 18 to the Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament.[175]</p>
    
<p>
  Law and order
</p>
<p>The Madras High Court was established on 26 June 1862 and is the highest judicial authority of the state with control over all the civil and criminal courts in the state.[176] It is headed by a Chief Justice and has a bench at Madurai since 2004.[176]

The Tamil Nadu Police, established as Madras state police in 1859, operates under the home ministry of the Government of Tamil Nadu and is responsible for maintaining law and order in the state.[177] As of 2023, it consists of more than 132,000 police personnel, headed by a Director General of Police.[178][179] Women form 17.6% of the police force and specifically handle violence against women through 222 special all-women police stations.[180][181][182] As of 2023, the state has 1854 police stations, the highest in the country, including 47 railway and 243 traffic police stations.[180][183] The traffic police under different district administrations are responsible for the traffic management in the respective regions.[184] The state is consistently ranked as one of the safest for women with a crime rate of 22 per 100,000 in 2018.[185]</p>

      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">cloting
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">Tamil women traditionally wear a sari, a garment that consists of a drape varying from 5 to 9 yards (4.6 to 8.2 m) in length and 2 to 4 feet (0.61 to 1.22 m) in breadth that is typically wrapped around the waist, with one end draped over the shoulder, baring the midriff, as according to Indian philosophy, the navel is considered as the source of life and creativity.[251][252] Ancient Tamil poetry such as the Cilappadhikaram, describes women in exquisite drapery or sari.[253] Women wear colourful silk saris on special occasions such as marriages.[254] The men wear a dhoti, a 4.5 metres (15 ft) long, white rectangular piece of non-stitched cloth often bordered in brightly coloured stripes. It is usually wrapped around the waist and the legs and knotted at the waist.[255] A colourful lungi with typical batik patterns is the most common form of male attire in the countryside.[256] People in urban areas generally wear tailored clothing and western dress is popular. Western-style school uniforms are worn by both boys and girls in schools, even in rural areas.[256] The Kanchipuram silk sari is a type of silk sari made in the Kanchipuram region in Tamil Nadu and these saris are worn as bridal and special occasion saris by most women in South India. It has been recognised as a Geographical indication by the Government of India in 2005–2006.[257][258] Kovai Cora is a type of cotton sari made in the Coimbatore.[258][259]
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">Cuisine
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">Rice is the diet staple and is served with sambar, rasam and poriyal as a part of a Tamil meal.[260] Coconut and spices are used extensively in Tamil cuisine. The region has a rich cuisine involving both traditional non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes made of rice, legumes and lentils with its distinct aroma and flavour achieved by the blending of flavourings and spices.[261][262] The traditional way of eating a meal involves being seated on the floor, having the food served on a banana leaf,[263] and using clean fingers of the right hand to take the food into the mouth.[264] After the meal, the fingers are washed; the easily degradable banana leaf is discarded or becomes fodder for cattle.[265] Eating on banana leaves is a custom thousands of years old, imparts a unique flavour to the food and is considered healthy.[266] Idli, dosa, uthappam, pongal and paniyaram are popular breakfast dishes in Tamil Nadu.[267] Palani Panchamirtham, Ooty varkey, Kovilpatti Kadalai Mittai, Manapparai Murukku and Srivilliputhur Palkova are unique foods that have been recognised as Geographical Indications.[268]
      </p>
  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">Literature
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">Tamil Nadu has an independent literary tradition dating back over 2500 years from the Sangam era.[7] Early Tamil literature was composed in three successive poetic assemblies known as the Tamil Sangams, the earliest of which, according to legend, were held on a now vanished continent far to the south of India.[269][270][271] This includes the oldest grammatical treatise, Tolkappiyam and the epics Cilappatikaram and Manimekalai.[272] The earliest epigraphic records found on rock edicts and hero stones date from around the 3rd century BCE.[273][274] The available literature from the Sangam period was categorised and compiled into two categories based roughly on chronology: the Patiṉeṇmēlkaṇakku consisting of Eṭṭuttokai and the Pattupattu and the Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku. The existent Tamil grammar is largely based on the 13th-century grammar book Naṉṉūl based on the Tolkāppiyam. Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely eḻuttu, sol, poruḷ, yāppu, aṇi.[275][276] Tirukkural, a book on ethics by Thiruvalluvar, is amongst the most popular works of Tamil literature.[277]

The Tamil literature that followed in the next 300 years after the Sangam period is generally called the "post-Sangam" literature which included the Five Great Epics and the Five Minor Epics.[278][279][280] In the early medieval period, Vaishnava and Shaiva literature became prominent following the Bhakti movement in the sixth century CE with hymns composed by the Alvars and the Nayanars.[281][282][283] In the following years, Tamil literature again flourished with notable works including Ramavataram, written in the 12th century CE by Kambar.[284] After a lull in the intermediate years due to various invasions and instability, the Tamil literature recovered in the 14th century CE, with the notable work being Tiruppukal by Arunagirinathar.[285] In 1578, the Portuguese published a Tamil book in old Tamil script named Thambiraan Vanakkam, thus making Tamil the first Indian language to be printed and published.[286] Tamil Lexicon, published by the University of Madras, is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language.[287] The 19th century gave rise to the Tamil Renaissance and writings and poems by authors such as Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai, U.V. Swaminatha Iyer, Ramalinga Swamigal, Maraimalai Adigal and Bharathidasan.[288][289] During the Indian Independence Movement, many Tamil poets and writers sought to provoke national spirit, social equity and secularist thoughts, notably Subramania Bharati and Bharathidasan.[290]
